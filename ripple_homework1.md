# Ripple Labs: Brief Case Study


* Name of company



Ripple Labs, Inc.





* When was the company incorporated?

2012

* Who are the founders of the company?

Ripple Labs was founded in 2012 --at the time, named OpenCoin, by Chris Larsen, Jed McCaleb and Ryan Fugger.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?


The origins of Ripple go back to 2004 when Ryan Fugger began developing what could be termed a decentralized credit, with the intention in his words to "build a new kind of monetary system based on the trust present in our ordinary social and business relationships." With the notion that interactions among users and the trust inherent in interpersonal relationships could mirror in a way the way that money functions as "promises" made by banks in the form of bank accounts. 

Eventually, these more conceptual notions would come to form the basis for RipplePay, which was founded in 2005, and according to the current form of the original RipplePay's website (it should be mentioned that the original RipplePay is now called RumplePay) "is a financial service that allows you to extend credit lines to your friends, family, and associates and make secure payments in traditional and online currencies."

Later, and tangential, to the project developed by Ryan Fugger, Jed McCaleb began to develop a digital currency system which utilized verification by consensus of users within a network, as opposed to the mining process used by other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Called OpenCoin, Jed McCaleb recruited David Schwartz, who has stayed on with Ripple Labs, and currently functions as the company's CTO, and Arthur Britto, to help develop a digital ledger that would become the foundation of the XRP digital asset.

In 2012, McCaleb brought Chris Larsen into the fold; Larsen, who had experience in the financial technology space in the 1990s-early 2000s co-founding E-Loan, one of the first online mortgage lenders, as well as Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending marketplace, brought experience and business acumen to the project, and continues to serve the company Executive Chairman. It is at this time when McCaleb and his team approached Fugger to integrate the concepts around RipplePay which involved routing payments through a mutual credit network.

XRP, their digital currency, was incorporated into OpenCoin into 2013, allowing for the exchange of multiple currencies through the platform. Also in 2013, McCaleb parted ways, and so too in 2013, at the Money 2020 Expo, OpenCoin announced that the company would change its name to Ripple Labs.





* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

The primary funding source of Ripple Labs has been the sale of its XRP cryptocurrency to a mix of institutional and retail investors; for example, between Q4 2016 and Q2 2020, Ripple Labs has sold just over 1.25B USD worth of XRP through various cryptocurrency exchanges.

Ripple Labs itself is a private company, and has closed five rounds of funding, starting with 9M USD in angel and seed funding in 2013; the most recent round of funding in December 2019 amounted to 200MUSD, taking the total invested to 298M, coming from various angel investors and venture capital firms, such as Google Ventures, and more notably, in more recent years, it has received significant funding from multinational financial and banking institutions, such as Standard Chartered, Banco Santander, and CME Group.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

According to Ripple's website:

> "Today's global payments infrastructure has more in common with the outdated postal system than this generation’s internet. Recognizing this friction in payments, our founders established Ripple with the idea of using blockchain technology and digital assets to enable financial institutions to send money across borders, instantly, reliably and for fractions of a penny."

More broadly, Ripple sees this future growth of infrastructure and interconnectivity as something it terms "The Internet of Value". Whereas, in the past three decades advancement in information technology has allowed for the instantanious, global exchange of information, value more broadly, not only money, but things of value such as votes, frequent flier miles, equities, intellectual property will be able to be exchanged with the same ease and speed as something such as an image, and done more reliably, and for a far lower cost to the consumer than the vast majority of typical wire exchanges.  

According to Ripple:

> "In the US, a typical international payment takes 3-5 days to settle, has an error rate of at least 5% and an average cost of $42. Worldwide, there are $180 trillion worth of cross-border payments made every year, with a combined cost of more than $1.7 trillion a year."

It is with blockchain technology that the exchange of different types of assets, the Internet of Value, is possible. By supplanting intermediaries, such as, for example, banks or credit card companies, transfers and exchanges of assets become decentralized and move as freely as information. 

More specifically, Ripple "believe(s) the most significant benefit of the internet of value will be for payments."

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Ripple markets RippleNet, its global payments network, to financial institutions, especially those involved in banking, financial services and money transfer. 

The potential market size of the clients Ripple aims to have adopt its services is vast, perhaps difficult to quantify. One estimate made by The Business Research Company put the size of the global financial services market at 22T USD in 2019. Also in 2019, the market capitalization of the publicly traded comapnies in the global banking industry was 7.9T USD, and, perhaps most presciently to observe in the case of Ripple and RippleNet, according to the World Bank, the global remittance industry totaled 689B USD in 2018.

Needless to say, the industries in which Ripple aims to position RippleNet and its blockchain technology represent a vast potential market, which perhaps begs the question of by which means, and to what extent a company such as Ripple will be able to service and offer the scale that works for the largest of potential future clients.

Through RippleNet and also its XRP digital asset, Ripple claims to offer its clients easy access to liquidity across numerous different currencies, quick, secure transactions within a matter of seconds for payments around the world. For XRP in particular, it distinguishes itself perhaps from other cryptocurrencies in that it is nested within a global payment network that functions as a financial service.

Therefore, whether Ripple, as global payments network, has competitors is perhaps difficult to quantify: according to Ripple, " (it) is the only enterprise blockchain company today with products in commercial use". That said, many companies that would be potential clients to Ripple, have themselves made forays into the use of blockchain to aid their processing of payments, a notable example being WesternUnion, competitor to Ripple's client MoneyGram, a company in which Ripple is currently invested.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

The space within the financial industry which Ripple occupies is perhaps hard to pin down as it at once offers its global payments network RippleNet as a service to institutions in banking, remittances and money transfers which uses XRP and the XRP Ledger, an open source blockchain technology. While it does not control XRP or the XRP Ledger, it is firmly in the cryptocurrency, and certainly in the blockchain space.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

With the emergence of blockchain technology from the beginning of the Bitcoin, and then directly afterward with the understanding that the blockchain technology behind it could be used in separate applications that involved exchange within networks. From there, things such as "smart contracts", pioneered by the likes of Etherium allow assets and financial instruments to be represented, not just cryptocurrencies.

 Further innovations include the "proof of stake" model, which differs from the "proof of work" model in which blockchains are secured by computing power that requires large amounts of effort --known as "miners," the operate large data centers in exchange for payment in cryptocurreny. In contrast, "proof of stake" utilizes consensus algorithms to create a distibuted consensus. 


On the forefront of technological innovation include blockchain scaling, which can speed up transactions by using the exact number of computers necessary, as opposed to having every computer in the network processing transactions. This increase in speed should allow blockchain technology, such as, perhaps a global payment network like RippleNet, to be fast enough t
